      application, there are some chances that the character set used to
      encode it is CP1252 (the same might apply to data received from an
      external xmlrpc server/client, but it is quite rare to find xmlrpc
      toolkits that encode to CP1252 instead of UTF8). It is a character set
      which is "almost" compatible with ISO 8859-1, but for a few extra
      characters.</p><p>PHP-XMLRPC only supports the ISO 8859-1 and UTF8 character sets.
      The net result of this situation is that those extra characters will not
      be properly encoded, and will be received at the other end of the
      XML-RPC tranmission as "garbled data". Unfortunately the library cannot
      provide real support for CP1252 because of limitations in the PHP 4 xml
      parser. Luckily, we tried our best to support this character set anyway,
      and, since version 2.2.1, there is some form of support, left commented
      in the code.</p><p>To properly encode outgoing data that is natively in CP1252, you
      will have to uncomment all relative code in the file
      <code class="filename">xmlrpc.inc</code> (you can search for the string "1252"),
      then set <code class="code">$GLOBALS['xmlrpc_internalencoding']='CP1252';</code>
      Please note that all incoming data will then be fed to your application
      as UTF-8 to avoid any potentail data loss.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch12s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch12.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch12s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">How can I save to a file the xml of the xmlrpc responses received
