# As of May 2019, Travis is deprecating VMs based on Precise, which means that we can only test on php >= 5.6 going forward
# (nb: this is not necessarily true yet - and we can use a different base for each php version, but we'll have to
# adapt composer.json plus the apache / env setup scripts to accommodate that...)
