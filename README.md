XMLRPC for PHP (a.k.a. PHPXMLRPC)
=================================

A php library for building xml-rpc clients and servers.

Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------

The recommended way to install this library is using Composer.

Detailed installation instructions are in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file, along with system requirements listing.

Documentation
-------------

* See the documentation page at [gggeek.github.io/phpxmlrpc](https://gggeek.github.io/phpxmlrpc) for a list of the
  library main features and all project related information, including information about online resources such as
  debuggers and demo servers.

* The user manual can be found in the doc/manual directory: [phpxmlrpc_manual.adoc](doc/manual/phpxmlrpc_manual.adoc).
  It includes sections about upgrading from previous versions and the Backwards compatibility promise as well as about
  running the library's testing suite and bundled debugger.

  The manual is formatted as an asciidoc file - if viewing it locally, it is recommended to either use an IDE which can
  natively render asciidoc, or view it as html with a browser by serving it via a webserver and accessing
  /doc/manual/index.html

  The latest version of the manual is also accessible online at https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/blob/master/doc/manual/phpxmlrpc_manual.adoc

* Automatically-generated documentation for the API is available online at [http://gggeek.github.io/phpxmlrpc/doc-4/api/index.html](http://gggeek.github.io/phpxmlrpc/doc-4/api/index.html)

* You are encouraged to look also at the code examples found in the demo/ directory.

  Note: to reduce the size of the download, the demo files are not part of the default package installed with Composer.
  You can either check them out online at https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/tree/master/demo, download them as a separate
  tarball from https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/releases or make sure they are available locally by installing the
  library using Composer option `--prefer-install=source`. Whatever the method chosen, make sure that the demo folder is
  not directly accessible from the internet, i.e. it is not within the webserver root directory).

Extras
------

* This library does include a visual debugger which can be used to troubleshoot connections to 3rd party xml-rpc servers.
  In case you'd like to use the debugger but do not have a working PHP installation, you can run it standalone as a
  Container image. Instructions can be found at https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-debugger

* A companion PHP library, which adds support for the JSON-RPC protocol, is available at https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-jsonrpc

* A companion PHP library, which adds support for XML-RPC servers to automatically generate API documentation, and more,
  is available at https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-extras

* Lats but not least, a Javascript library, implementing both XML-RPC and JSON-RPC clients using a very similar API, is
  available at https://github.com/gggeek/jsxmlrpc
